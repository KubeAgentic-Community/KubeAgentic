## üöÄ Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the process of deploying KubeAgentic and your first AI agent.

### Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster.
- `kubectl` installed and configured to connect to your cluster.

### 1. Install KubeAgentic

You can install the KubeAgentic operator and its components using the following command:

```bash
# This will install the CRD, RBAC, and the operator deployment.
# For remote installation
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KubeAgentic-Community/kubeagentic/main/deploy/all.yaml

# For local installation
kubectl apply -f deploy/all.yaml
```

### üê≥ Docker Images

KubeAgentic provides optimized Docker images hosted on Docker Hub:

- **Operator Image**: `sudeshmu/kubeagentic:operator-latest` (108MB)
- **Agent Runtime**: `sudeshmu/kubeagentic:agent-latest` (625MB - 66% smaller than original)

**Image Optimization Features:**
- Multi-stage builds for minimal size
- Red Hat UBI Minimal base images for security
- Non-root user execution
- Optimized Python dependencies

**Available Tags:**
- `operator-latest`: Latest stable operator
- `agent-latest`: Latest optimized agent runtime
- `agent-optimized`: Explicitly optimized agent version

```bash
# Pull images directly
docker pull sudeshmu/kubeagentic:operator-latest
docker pull sudeshmu/kubeagentic:agent-latest
```

### 2. Create an API Key Secret

Before deploying an agent, you need to create a Kubernetes secret to store your API key.

```bash
# Replace 'your-openai-api-key' with your actual OpenAI API key.
kubectl create secret generic openai-secret \
  --from-literal=api-key='your-openai-api-key'
```

### 3. Deploy Your First Agent

Create a file named `my-agent.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
# my-agent.yaml
apiVersion: ai.example.com/v1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: my-assistant
spec:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4
  systemPrompt: "You are a helpful customer service assistant."
  apiSecretRef:
    name: openai-secret
    key: api-key
```

Now, deploy the agent to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f my-agent.yaml
```

### 4. Interact with Your Agent

Once the agent is running, you can interact with it by port-forwarding its service:

```bash
# This will forward local port 8080 to the agent's service.
kubectl port-forward service/my-assistant-service 8080:80
```

In a new terminal, you can send a message to your agent using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello! How can you help me?"}'
```

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed and interacted with your first AI agent using KubeAgentic.

## üîó Framework Options

KubeAgentic supports two execution frameworks to match your use case:

### Direct Framework (Default)
Perfect for simple, fast interactions:

```yaml
spec:
  framework: direct  # Simple API calls
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4
  systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant."
  tools:
  - name: calculator
    description: "Basic math operations"
```

- **‚úÖ Best for**: Chat bots, simple Q&A, straightforward tool usage
- **‚úÖ Benefits**: Fast response times, minimal resource usage, easy debugging
- **‚ö° Performance**: ~100-500ms response times

### LangGraph Framework
Ideal for complex, multi-step workflows:

```yaml
spec:
  framework: langgraph  # Advanced workflows
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4
  systemPrompt: "You are an advanced problem-solving agent."
  langgraphConfig:
    graphType: conditional
    nodes:
    - name: analyze_problem
      type: llm
      prompt: "Analyze: {user_input}"
    - name: gather_data
      type: tool
      tool: data_lookup
    - name: provide_solution
      type: llm
      prompt: "Solve based on: {data}"
    edges:
    - from: analyze_problem
      to: gather_data
    - from: gather_data
      to: provide_solution
    entrypoint: analyze_problem
```

- **‚úÖ Best for**: Customer service workflows, research tasks, complex reasoning
- **‚úÖ Benefits**: Stateful conversations, multi-step logic, tool orchestration
- **‚ö° Performance**: ~1-5s response times (depending on workflow complexity)

</details>

## üèóÔ∏è How it Works

KubeAgentic follows the standard Kubernetes operator pattern. Here's a brief overview of its architecture:

- **Agent CRD**: A Custom Resource Definition that defines the `Agent` resource, allowing you to manage your agents declaratively.
- **Controller**: The core component of the operator, which runs in the cluster and watches for changes to `Agent` resources.
- **Reconciliation Loop**: When an `Agent` resource is created, updated, or deleted, the controller's reconciliation loop is triggered. It then creates or updates the necessary Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, etc.) to match the desired state defined in the `Agent` resource.

## üîß Configuration

### Basic Configuration Options

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `provider` | AI service to use | `openai`, `claude`, `gemini`, `vllm` |
| `model` | Specific model | `gpt-4`, `claude-3-sonnet`, `gemini-pro` |
| `systemPrompt` | Agent personality/instructions | `"You are a helpful assistant"` |
| `apiSecretRef` | Kubernetes secret with API key | `{name: "my-secret", key: "api-key"}` |
| `replicas` | Number of agent instances | `1` (default), `3` for HA |
| `resources` | CPU/memory limits | Standard Kubernetes resources |
| `endpoint` | Custom API endpoint | For self-hosted models |

For a detailed list of all configuration options, please refer to the [API Reference](docs/api.md).

## üìä Monitoring Your Agents

```bash
# List all agents
kubectl get agents

# Check agent status  
kubectl describe agent my-assistant

# View agent logs
kubectl logs -l kubeagentic.ai/agent=my-assistant

# Monitor resource usage
kubectl top pods -l kubeagentic.ai/agent=my-assistant
```

## üß™ Development

Interested in contributing to KubeAgentic? Here's how you can get started with local development.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Docker
- `make`

### Running the Operator Locally

You can run the operator locally against a Kubernetes cluster. This is useful for rapid development and testing.

```bash
# This will run the operator on your local machine.
make run
```

For more detailed information on local development and testing, please see our [Local Testing Guide](local-testing/README.md).

## üîí Security

- **üîê API Keys**: Stored securely as Kubernetes Secrets
- **üë§ Non-root**: Agents run as non-privileged users
- **üåê Network Policies**: Control agent communication
- **üõ°Ô∏è RBAC**: Fine-grained access control

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent stuck in Pending state**:
```bash
# Check if the secret exists
kubectl get secret openai-secret

# Check agent events
kubectl describe agent my-assistant

# Check operator logs
kubectl logs -n kubeagentic-system deployment/kubeagentic-operator
```

**API connection errors**:
- Verify your API key is correct and has proper permissions
- Check if the endpoint is reachable (for custom endpoints)
- Ensure sufficient API quota/credits

**Resource constraints**:
```bash
# Check node resources
kubectl describe nodes

# Adjust resource requests if needed
kubectl patch agent my-assistant --type='merge' -p='{"spec":{"resources":{"requests":{"memory":"128Mi","cpu":"50m"}}}}'
```
