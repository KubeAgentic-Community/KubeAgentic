# LangGraph Framework Guide

The **LangGraph Framework** enables complex, stateful workflows for AI agents that require multi-step reasoning, conditional logic, and sophisticated tool orchestration. It's built on LangChain's LangGraph library for creating sophisticated agent workflows.

## When to Use LangGraph Framework

✅ **Perfect for:**
- Complex customer service workflows
- Multi-step research and analysis tasks
- Conditional logic between operations
- Stateful conversation management
- Advanced tool orchestration and chaining
- Decision trees and branching workflows
- Long-running task coordination

❌ **Not ideal for:**
- Simple chat interactions
- High-throughput, low-latency applications
- Basic Q&A scenarios
- Minimal resource environments
- Straightforward tool usage

## Performance Characteristics

- **Response Time**: ~1-5 seconds (workflow dependent)
- **Resource Usage**: Higher CPU and memory requirements
- **Concurrency**: Moderate - manages stateful sessions
- **Scalability**: Good vertical scaling, moderate horizontal scaling
- **Debugging**: Visual workflow debugging capabilities

## Workflow Components

### Node Types

1. **LLM Nodes**: Call language models with prompts
2. **Tool Nodes**: Execute external tools and APIs  
3. **Action Nodes**: Perform system actions or integrations

### State Management

- **Persistent State**: Maintains conversation context across workflow steps
- **Variable Passing**: Share data between nodes through state variables
- **Session Storage**: Keep track of user sessions and conversation history

### Edge Types

- **Conditional Edges**: Route based on conditions and logic
- **Unconditional Edges**: Direct workflow progression
- **Dynamic Routing**: Runtime decision making

## Use Cases & Examples

    You are an advanced customer service agent with access to multiple systems.
    
    Your goal is to systematically resolve customer issues by:
    1. Understanding the customer's problem
    2. Gathering necessary information
    3. Checking company policies
    4. Taking appropriate action
    5. Following up as needed
    
    Always be professional, empathetic, and thorough in your approach.

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design

1. **Keep state minimal**: Only store essential data in workflow state
2. **Design for failure**: Include error handling and recovery paths  
3. **Optimize node order**: Place fast operations before slow ones
4. **Use conditional logic**: Avoid unnecessary operations with smart routing
5. **Plan for debugging**: Include logging and state inspection points

### Performance Optimization

```yaml
# Efficient resource allocation for LangGraph
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 500m      # Baseline for workflow processing
    memory: 1Gi    # State storage and LLM responses
  limits:
    cpu: 1.5       # Burst capacity for complex workflows  
    memory: 3Gi    # Handle large state objects
```

### State Management

```yaml
# Well-designed state schema
state:
  # Core workflow data
  user_request: {type: string}
  current_step: {type: string}
  
  # Domain-specific data
  customer_id: {type: string}
  order_data: {type: object}
  
  # Control flow
  workflow_status: {type: string}
  errors: {type: array}
  retry_count: {type: integer}
```

### Error Handling

```yaml
# Include error handling nodes
nodes:
- name: error_handler
  type: llm
  condition: "errors is not None and len(errors) > 0"
  prompt: |
    Handle the following workflow errors:
    Errors: {errors}
    Current State: {current_step}
    
    Determine the appropriate recovery action or user message.
```

### Monitoring Workflows

**Key metrics for LangGraph agents:**
- Workflow completion rate
- Average workflow duration  
- Node execution times
- State size over time
- Error rates by node
- Resource utilization patterns

**Common optimization strategies:**
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Parallelize independent operations
- Implement smart retry logic
- Use circuit breakers for external services
- Monitor and optimize state size

## Migration to LangGraph

**When to migrate from Direct Framework:**

✅ **Migrate when you need:**
- Multi-step conditional logic
- State persistence across interactions  
- Complex tool orchestration
- Decision trees and branching
- Workflow visibility and debugging

**Migration example:**

**Before (Direct)** - Limited tool coordination:
```yaml
framework: direct
tools:
- name: lookup_customer
- name: lookup_order  
- name: process_refund
# Tools called independently, no workflow logic
```

**After (LangGraph)** - Systematic workflow:
```yaml
framework: langgraph
langgraphConfig:
  nodes:
  - name: lookup_customer
    type: tool
    tool: lookup_customer
  - name: lookup_order  
    type: tool
    tool: lookup_order
    condition: "customer_data.has_orders == true"
  - name: process_refund
    type: tool  
    tool: process_refund
    condition: "order_data.refundable == true"
  edges:
  - from: lookup_customer
    to: lookup_order
  - from: lookup_order
    to: process_refund
```

The LangGraph Framework excels when you need sophisticated reasoning, complex workflows, and stateful interactions that go beyond simple request-response patterns.
