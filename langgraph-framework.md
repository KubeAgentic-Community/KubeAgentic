# LangGraph Framework Guide

The **LangGraph Framework** enables complex, stateful workflows for AI agents that require multi-step reasoning, conditional logic, and sophisticated tool orchestration. It's built on LangChain's LangGraph library for creating sophisticated agent workflows.

## When to Use LangGraph Framework

✅ **Perfect for:**
- Complex customer service workflows
- Multi-step research and analysis tasks
- Conditional logic between operations
- Stateful conversation management
- Advanced tool orchestration and chaining
- Decision trees and branching workflows
- Long-running task coordination

❌ **Not ideal for:**
- Simple chat interactions
- High-throughput, low-latency applications
- Basic Q&A scenarios
- Minimal resource environments
- Straightforward tool usage

## Performance Characteristics

- **Response Time**: ~1-5 seconds (workflow dependent)
- **Resource Usage**: Higher CPU and memory requirements
- **Concurrency**: Moderate - manages stateful sessions
- **Scalability**: Good vertical scaling, moderate horizontal scaling
- **Debugging**: Visual workflow debugging capabilities

## Quick Example

```yaml
apiVersion: ai.example.com/v1
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: workflow-support
  namespace: customer-service
spec:
  framework: langgraph      # Complex workflows
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4
  systemPrompt: "You are an advanced customer service agent with systematic problem-solving capabilities."
  apiSecretRef:
    name: openai-secret
    key: api-key
  
  # Define the workflow
  langgraphConfig:
    graphType: conditional
    nodes:
    - name: analyze_issue
      type: llm
      prompt: "Analyze this customer issue: {user_input}"
      outputs: ["issue_type", "priority"]
    
    - name: lookup_data
      type: tool
      tool: customer_lookup
      condition: "issue_type == 'account'"
      inputs: ["customer_id"]
      outputs: ["customer_data"]
    
    - name: resolve_issue
      type: llm
      prompt: "Resolve based on: {customer_data}"
      outputs: ["resolution"]
    
    edges:
    - from: analyze_issue
      to: lookup_data
      condition: "issue_type == 'account'"
    - from: lookup_data
      to: resolve_issue
    
    entrypoint: analyze_issue
    endpoints: [resolve_issue]
  
  tools:
  - name: customer_lookup
    description: Look up customer information
    inputSchema:
      type: object
      properties:
        customer_id: {type: string}
      required: ["customer_id"]
  
  replicas: 1
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 1Gi
    limits:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 2Gi
```

## Workflow Components

### Node Types

**LLM Nodes**: Call language models with prompts
```yaml
- name: analyze_request
  type: llm
  prompt: "Analyze: {user_input}"
  outputs: ["analysis_result"]
```

**Tool Nodes**: Execute external tools and APIs
```yaml
- name: lookup_data
  type: tool
  tool: database_search
  inputs: ["search_query"]
  outputs: ["search_results"]
```

**Action Nodes**: Perform system actions
```yaml
- name: send_notification
  type: action
  action: notify_team
  inputs: ["message", "priority"]
```

### State Management

- **Persistent State**: Maintains conversation context across workflow steps
- **Variable Passing**: Share data between nodes through state variables  
- **Session Storage**: Keep track of user sessions and conversation history

### Conditional Logic

**Simple conditions:**
```yaml
condition: "issue_type == 'billing'"
```

**Complex conditions:**
```yaml
condition: "priority == 'high' and customer_tier == 'premium'"
```

## Complex Use Cases

### 1. Multi-Step Customer Service

Handle complex support scenarios that require multiple data lookups and decision points:

```yaml
langgraphConfig:
  graphType: conditional
  
  nodes:
  - name: classify_issue
    type: llm
    prompt: |
      Classify this customer request:
      Request: {user_input}
      
      Determine issue type, priority, and required data.
    outputs: ["issue_type", "priority", "customer_id"]
  
  - name: fetch_customer_data
    type: tool
    tool: customer_lookup
    condition: "customer_id is not None"
    
  - name: check_policies
    type: tool
    tool: policy_engine
    inputs: ["issue_type", "customer_data"]
    
  - name: escalate_or_resolve
    type: llm
    condition: "policy_decision == 'escalate'"
    prompt: "Escalate this case: {customer_data}"
  
  edges:
  - from: classify_issue
    to: fetch_customer_data
  - from: fetch_customer_data  
    to: check_policies
  - from: check_policies
    to: escalate_or_resolve
```

### 2. Research and Analysis Pipeline

Multi-stage research that gathers information from multiple sources:

```yaml
langgraphConfig:
  graphType: sequential
  
  nodes:
  - name: decompose_query
    type: llm
    prompt: "Break down research question: {user_input}"
    outputs: ["search_terms", "research_strategy"]
  
  - name: gather_sources
    type: tool
    tool: web_search
    inputs: ["search_terms"]
  
  - name: validate_sources  
    type: llm
    prompt: "Validate source credibility: {web_results}"
    outputs: ["validated_facts"]
  
  - name: synthesize_findings
    type: llm
    prompt: "Create comprehensive analysis: {validated_facts}"
    outputs: ["final_report"]
```

### 3. Decision Making Engine

Complex business decision analysis with multiple criteria:

```yaml
langgraphConfig:
  graphType: hierarchical
  
  nodes:
  - name: define_decision
    type: llm
    prompt: "Structure decision problem: {user_input}"
    
  - name: gather_market_data
    type: tool
    tool: market_research
    
  - name: financial_analysis
    type: tool  
    tool: financial_calculator
    
  - name: risk_assessment
    type: tool
    tool: risk_analyzer
    
  - name: multi_criteria_evaluation
    type: llm
    prompt: "Evaluate options using gathered data"
    
  - name: final_recommendation
    type: llm
    prompt: "Generate executive recommendation"
```

## Configuration Best Practices

### Resource Planning

LangGraph workflows require more resources than direct agents:

```yaml
# Typical LangGraph resource allocation
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 500m        # Baseline for workflow processing
    memory: 1Gi      # State storage and LLM responses
  limits:
    cpu: 1.5         # Burst capacity for complex workflows
    memory: 3Gi      # Handle large state objects
```

### State Design

Keep state minimal and well-structured:

```yaml
state:
  # Core workflow data
  user_request: {type: string}
  current_step: {type: string}
  
  # Domain-specific data  
  customer_id: {type: string}
  order_data: {type: object}
  
  # Control flow
  workflow_status: {type: string}
  errors: {type: array}
```

### Error Handling

Include error handling in your workflows:

```yaml
nodes:
- name: error_handler
  type: llm
  condition: "errors is not None"
  prompt: |
    Handle workflow errors: {errors}
    Provide user-friendly error message.
```

### Performance Optimization

1. **Parallelize independent operations** where possible
2. **Cache frequently accessed data** in state
3. **Implement smart retry logic** for external services
4. **Monitor state size** to prevent memory issues
5. **Use circuit breakers** for unreliable external dependencies

## Monitoring and Debugging

**Key metrics for LangGraph agents:**
- Workflow completion rate
- Average workflow duration
- Node execution times  
- State size over time
- Error rates by node
- Resource utilization patterns

**Debugging strategies:**
- Add logging nodes for state inspection
- Use conditional nodes for error handling
- Monitor workflow paths taken
- Track state changes between nodes

## Migration from Direct Framework

**When to migrate:**

✅ **Upgrade to LangGraph when you need:**
- Multi-step conditional logic
- State persistence across interactions
- Complex tool orchestration  
- Decision trees and branching
- Workflow visibility and debugging

**Migration example:**

**Before (Direct)** - Limited coordination:
```yaml
framework: direct
tools:
- name: lookup_customer
- name: process_refund
# Independent tool calls
```

**After (LangGraph)** - Systematic workflow:
```yaml  
framework: langgraph
langgraphConfig:
  nodes:
  - name: lookup_customer
    type: tool
    tool: lookup_customer
  - name: validate_refund
    type: llm  
    condition: "customer_data.tier == 'premium'"
  - name: process_refund
    type: tool
    tool: process_refund
    condition: "refund_approved == true"
  edges:
  - from: lookup_customer
    to: validate_refund
  - from: validate_refund
    to: process_refund
```

## Advanced Features

### Workflow Types

- **Sequential**: Linear progression through steps
- **Parallel**: Concurrent execution of independent operations
- **Conditional**: Branch based on logic and state
- **Hierarchical**: Nested workflows and sub-processes

### State Persistence

LangGraph maintains state across conversation turns:

```yaml
state:
  conversation_history: {type: array}
  user_preferences: {type: object}
  task_progress: {type: object}
  context_data: {type: object}
```

### Dynamic Routing

Runtime decision making for workflow paths:

```yaml
edges:
- from: analyze_issue
  to: high_priority_path
  condition: "priority == 'urgent'"
- from: analyze_issue  
  to: standard_path
  condition: "priority != 'urgent'"
```
